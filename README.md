gaudi
=====

gaudi is a simple reddit reader based on HTML5, CSS 3 and Javascript.
There is a [demo](http://playground.boxandcircle.com/gaudi/) if you want to see it in action.


Next steps
----------
There are a few items on my personal todo list, including

* enable touch-support
* make a imgur.com parser
* ~~leverage localStorage API to remember visited items~~
* extend search and subreddit options (e.g. top, new, controversial, user search)
* implement a comment view
* make a user login to add vote functionality and more

For your own suggestions, you can use the _issues_ tab


Credits
-------
*gaudi* relies heavily on other open source projects. Some of them are

* first of all the [reddit API](http://reddit.com/dev/api) ([github](https://github.com/reddit/reddit))
* [backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org), a structural JS framework that saved me since commit 5cce3da8d04dfeeb12c5e47309b745b3a40ab8f9 ([github](http://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/)) 
* [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com), a great, tiny CSS framework by [@csswizardry](http://csswizardry.com) ([github](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css))
* [Source Sans Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html), an open source font by Adobe ([github](https://github.com/adobe/source-sans-pro))
* [SubtlePatterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/wild-oliva/), a wonderful library of tileable background patterns ([github](https://github.com/subtlepatterns/SubtlePatterns))

Furthermore, *gaudi* is built with [Mixture](http://mixture.io)
