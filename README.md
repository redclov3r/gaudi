* first of all the [reddit API](http://reddit.com/dev/api) ([github](https://github.com/reddit/reddit))
* [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com), a great, tiny CSS framework by [@csswizardry](http://csswizardry.com) ([github](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css))
* [Source Sans Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html), an open source font by Adobe ([github](https://github.com/adobe/source-sans-pro))
* [SubtlePatterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/wild-oliva/), a wonderful library of tileable background patterns ([github](https://github.com/subtlepatterns/SubtlePatterns))

Furthermore, *gaudi* is built with [Mixture](http://mixture.io)
